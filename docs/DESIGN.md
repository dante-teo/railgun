# Design

## Product experience

Railgun's interactive surface is a dense, full-screen terminal workspace. A
compact branded header anchors a repaintable transcript; sticky todos,
suggestions or approval, the composer, and a slim status bar stay visible at
the bottom. One-shot output and `--list-sessions` remain ordinary terminal
text.

## Appearance

Railgun owns two internal semantic palettes, mint-dark and mint-light. It asks
the terminal for its canvas appearance first, then the OS, then defaults to
dark. Terminal changes apply immediately; OS changes re-query the terminal
before applying the OS value. There is no manual override or `/skin` command,
and legacy `~/.railgun/config.json` is ignored without being removed.

The UI never paints a global background, preserving the terminal canvas.
Tinted user, selection, status, approval, todo, tool, and code surfaces always
set an explicit foreground. Text labels and glyphs (`YOU`, `RAILGUN`, `ERROR`,
`APPROVAL`, `[x]`, `✔`, `✘`) preserve meaning independently of color.

## Interaction

- Enter submits; Shift+Enter inserts a newline when enhanced keyboard reporting
  is available. The composer grows from one to six rows and caps lower in short
  terminals. Paste may contain multiple lines.
- Tab completes an active slash suggestion. Otherwise it is consumed as the
  reserved future enqueue binding. Busy and approval states disable editing
  without deleting the draft. `Ctrl+U` clears the draft.
- The mouse wheel scrolls transcript history by rows. PageUp/PageDown move by
  one viewport. Home/End jump to the beginning/end. New output and resizes
  preserve bottom-follow only when already at the bottom; otherwise an
  unseen-row cue reserves one visible transcript row.
- `/exit`, `/help`, and `/clear` are the available commands. Shell approval uses
  `y`, `n`, or Escape.
- Completed replies use GFM Markdown with wrapped prose, lists, links, tables,
  and themed fenced-code boxes with language labels. Streaming fragments remain
  plain until completion.
- Generic thinking and live tool states use animated mint activity rows. Agent
  narration is committed before a following compact tool row, preserving the
  chronological event sequence instead of pinning active text below tools.

## Lifecycle and accessibility

Interactive TTY sessions and the resume chooser enter the alternate screen and
restore it on every exit path. Non-TTY output and `INK_SCREEN_READER=true` skip
the alternate screen. The screen-reader path uses Ink's accessible rendering;
all controls remain keyboard-only and all status meaning has a textual cue.

## Session chooser

The chooser shares the live automatic theme, header, selected surface, compact
metadata, and status bar. Up/Down wraps, Enter resumes, and Escape/Ctrl-C
cancels. Its newest-first list viewport tracks selection across terminal
resizes.
