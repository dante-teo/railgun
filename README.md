# Railgun

An EggJS based sub framework build for modularize folder structure.

## QuickStart
```bash
npm install @dantea/railgun
```

## What does it do?

The default component loader of eggjs will load all the controller and services javscript file from the below folder:
```
app/controller/user.js
app/service/user.js
```

But some of the developers are prefered componentize style such like:
```
app/user/user.service.js
app/user/user.controller.js
```

This is the purpose of Railgun framework.
